                     From his tumultuous childhood in Detroit, troubled relationship with his mother, on-again off-again relationship with
                     Kimberly Scott, substance abuse problems, and record-breaking career as a hip hop artist, Eminem has a lot going on.

                     Releases debut album Infinite but few people notice. Those who do accuse him of ripping off other artists. Those who
                     don’t accuse him of plagiarism, and mock his little-too-late anti-Gulf War lyrics. He sells about five hundred copies
                     from the backseat of his car.
